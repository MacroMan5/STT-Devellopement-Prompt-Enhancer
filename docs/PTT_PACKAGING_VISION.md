# Packaging Vision: PTT Prompt Enhancer Module

Goal: ship the PTT voice capture + prompt enhancement stack as a reusable package that can be bootstrapped into any project without copying source files manually.

## Distribution Targets

- PyPI package (`lazy-ptt-enhancer`) installable via `pip install lazy-ptt-enhancer`.
- CLI entry points (`lazy-ptt-daemon`, `lazy-ptt-enhance`) and Python API (`lazy_ptt`).
- REST/gRPC endpoints so non-Python projects can trigger transcription + enhancement remotely.
- Cookiecutter/scaffold integration that installs the package and generates config skeletons.
- Claude framework plugin metadata for automatic slash-command wiring.
- Official GitHub repository (`MacroMan5/STT-Devellopement-Prompt-Enhancer`) hosting public issue tracker, discussions, and releases.
- Pluggable domain packs (development, marketing, finance, research) distributed as optional extras.

## Release Workflow

- Separate repository with CI building wheels/sdist, running tests, and publishing to PyPI.
- GitHub releases include changelog and artifacts; documentation site (e.g. MkDocs) describes usage.

## Deployment Automation

- Scaffold scripts call `pip install --upgrade lazy-ptt-enhancer` during project bootstrap.
- GPU dependencies (CUDA/cuDNN) documented with CPU fallback.
- Dockerfile reference provided for containerized installs.
- Provide post-install command to scaffold API service configs (FastAPI/Flask) and webhook integrations.

## Repository Setup

- Initialize dedicated repository `STT-Devellopement-Prompt-Enhancer`.
- Configure remote: `git remote add origin https://github.com/MacroMan5/STT-Devellopement-Prompt-Enhancer.git`.
- Default branch `main`; enforce PR checks and release tagging.
